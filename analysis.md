## Layer 7, Head 10

I decided to test verb -> direct object relationships.  
Layer 1 Head 1 shows relations between "studied" → "rocket" → "science," but they are not very bright.  
Layer 1 Head 8 has two brightest squares: "studied" → "science" and "science" → "rocket." It also shows a strong relation for "parked" → "car" in the second sentence.  
Layer 7 Head 10: the brightest square is "studied" → "science." It also works well for the second sentence.  

Overall, Layer 1 Head 8 and Layer 7 Head 10 capture the verb → direct object relationship effectively in both sentences.

Example Sentences:
- I studied rocket science in [MASK]. 
- I parked my car on the [MASK].

## Layer 9, Head 11

Next rule: pronouns -> antecedents relationships.
In the first sentence I expect to find strong relationships between "wife" and "she".
Layer 1 Head 2 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"
Layer 3 Head 9 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"
Layer 4 Head 11 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"
Layer 5 Head 4 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"
Layer 9 Head 11 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"

In the second sentence I expect to find strong relationships between "manager" and "he"
Layer 3 Head 9 has a noticable relations between "manager" and "he"
Layer 9 Head 11 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"
Layer 10 Head 2 has a strong relations between "wife" and "she"

I chose Layer 9, Head 11 because I found strong relationships in both cases. 

Example Sentences:
- I asked my wife to walk with dog and she [MASK].
- Anna talked to my manager about a new position and he [MASK].
